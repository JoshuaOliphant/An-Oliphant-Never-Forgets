# Drafts to Jekyll Acton

I created a Drafts action that sends a note to the Github repository where I store my Jekyll site, and posted it to the [Drafts directory](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/2QL).  Thought it would be nice to quickly whip up a post, and generally use Drafts to write posts, and be able to publish with a click of a button.
