title: "Slow Productivity: do fewer things"

Last night I read the proposition in Slow Productivity on doing fewer things. This morning, the ideas that stick with me are:
- No more than 2 or 3 missions at any given time. Missions are very high level, and may have no real end. To me, missions seem like focus areas, like "Learn to play guitar" or "Become an AI Engineer".
- Missions are broken up into projects, and projects are anything that cannot be done in one sitting.
- Only 1 project should be focused on in a day. This doesn't mean you can't do other tasks in a day, but these other tasks are more like daily chores, exercise, etc., and don't belong to any particular project/mission.
