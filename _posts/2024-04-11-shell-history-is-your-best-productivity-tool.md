This is a [very good blog post](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/110) by Martin Heinz on how to configure zsh to take better advantage of your shell history.

At the end he mentions [atuin](attuin.sh), for syncing your shell history across multiple devices with end-to-end encryption. I've been using it for a while and the shell history search is also quite nice.
