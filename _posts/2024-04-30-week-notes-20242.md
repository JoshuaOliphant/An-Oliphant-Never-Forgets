- Still going mostly without coffee, except for a very good spring latte at Ember Goods during the Olympia Art Walk â˜•.
- First interview on Friday, two more this next week ðŸ¤ž

In deeplearning.ai and pdf benchmarker open source project
- Added a [LlamaParse](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/introducing-llamacloud-and-llamaparse-af8cedf9006b) scraper. Output to Markdown was very nice, handled tables well.
Learnings
- Completed the Terraform module in the [DevOps for Developers](https://www.educative.io/path/devops-for-developers) course on Educative.io.

- Had started hatching a 5-year plan a couple weeks ago, and spent some time this week honing in on the first year. It's against my nature to do long-term planning, but I'm pushing myself to do it. As I get more into it, the more I am enjoying it. This is what I am thinking for the next year:
	- Focus on learning and building AI Engineering projects. I have been using this post on [AI Engineering](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer) to guide my thinking around it. Essentially, it is about a new class of software engineers that are focused on using AI tools and API's to build applications.
	- AI tools I'm currently interested in and trying out are AutoGen (agents), Unstructured, Instructor, and LangChain. I've been tinkering with AutoGen lately and it's blowing my mind a bit.
	- Thinking about how I can become a successful individual consultant. Trying to hone in on what could be my "services". I've been very interested in Dagger for CI/CD pipelines, so I plan to use it for any side-projects to try it out. It appeals to be because not locked into vendor, can use it everywhere (including locally).
