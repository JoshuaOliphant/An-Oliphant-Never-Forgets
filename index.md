Hello, this is Josh. This will be a place where I post notes on things I learn. I'm a generalist ([undercover?](https://ochagavia.nl/blog/the-undercover-generalist/)) software engineer, I've worked with Kubernetes and Kafka, built stuff in Java, love automating in Python, worked on CI/CD pipelines a bunch. Currently, I'm spending lots of extra time getting better at Python, tinkering with [AI Engineering](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer), and getting into the [HOWL stack](https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-on-whatever-youd-like/).
