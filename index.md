Hello, this is Josh. This will be a place where I post notes on things I learn. I'm a generalist software engineer, I've worked with Kubernetes and Kafka, built stuff in Java and Python primarily, worked on CI/CD pipelines a bunch. Currently, I'm spending time getting better at Python (which I like more than Java), building [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) apps, and picking up [AI Engineer skills](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer).
