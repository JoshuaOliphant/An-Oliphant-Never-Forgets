This page is inspired by [Jamie Tanna's now page](https://www.jvt.me/now/),
which was, in turn, inspired by others.

**What am I up to now?**

- Automation, I'm trying to automate every little bit of my workflow, even if it takes longer to automate than actually do the task. Besides being fun, it has become a way to constantly put myself in the mindset of automating everything. Plus, ChatGPT makes most tasks that I wouldn't bother automating trivial.
- Working on my blog, trying to make it a regular part of my routine (I even made a [Drafts action](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/2QL), and looking at examples of other people's blogs that I like.
- I was recently laid off at Nortal, where I worked as a Senior Engineer focused on SRE and DevOps. Creating Gitlab pipelines that deploy to Kubernetes, containerizing, and using Helm.
- Taking care of the birds that live on my property.

**What are my interests?**

- Travel
- Camping, hiking, backpacking, etc.
- Sourdough baking
- Reading
- htmx
- Python
- Automation
- DevOps

My primary programming languages are Python and Java, and while I'm still better at Java than Python, I love Python much more than Java, and I'm working hard to switch over to Python.
